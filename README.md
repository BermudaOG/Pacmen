# Pacmen 
## This is a test in spawning pacmen and making them move while also taking collison with the borders of the screen into account 
In this demo you can spawn pacmen with the first button, and get them to start moving using the second button. You can also increase speed by continuing to press the second button. For future improvements, i can add collison effects between each pacman
